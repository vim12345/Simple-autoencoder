# Simple-autoencoder

# Description:
An autoencoder is a type of artificial neural network used for learning efficient codings of input data in an unsupervised manner. It consists of two parts: an encoder that compresses the input and a decoder that reconstructs it. In this project, we build a simple autoencoder using Keras to compress and reconstruct the Iris dataset.

# 🔍 What This Project Shows:
* Compresses 4D data to 2D using an autoencoder

* Learns a non-linear transformation

* Visualizes learned embeddings and structure between classes
